# Sin and Cos Functions Visualization

This repository contains a Python project that demonstrates how to visualize the **sin(x)** and **cos(x)** functions using the **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Pandas** libraries.

## Project Overview

In this project, we plot the **sin(x)** and **cos(x)** functions over a range of values, and display them using different styles, markers, and colors. Additionally, the data for these functions is stored in a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and inspection.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:

- **NumPy**: For generating data points and performing mathematical calculations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating the plots and visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For handling and displaying the data in a structured format.

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
